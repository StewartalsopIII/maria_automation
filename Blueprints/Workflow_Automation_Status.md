**Legend:**
- ✅ **Automated** - Currently working in the system
- 🔧 **To-Be-Automated** - Planned or possible to automate
- 📥 **Automatable Input** - Step is manual (in Riverside), but the *content* can be auto-generated
- 👤 **Manual** - Requires human judgment/action (always manual)

## 4. Implementation Details

### Task 1: Fix Social Media Posts (1 per clip)
**File:** `gas_project/Code.gs` → `generateSocialPosts()`

| Current | Target |
|---------|--------|
| 3 generic posts | 6-7 posts (1 per clip) |
| Not tied to clips | Each post uses its clip's hook/content |

**Implementation approach:**
- Modify prompt to generate one post per clip
- Pass clip suggestions as input so posts reference specific content

---

### Task 2: Add CTA Generation (1 per clip)
**File:** `gas_project/Code.gs` → New function `generateCTAs()`

**Prompt to use:**
```
Write a CTA, like the examples below, that follows the ending of the clip shown below to generate some intrigue, make people want to hear more/finish listening to what follows. Use the whole transcript of the conversation to include something like a mention/question to the audience if they would like to know more about something specific about what the guest says in the clip (in the case the guest goes deeper into that) or if they would like to know how what is being said in the clip relates to other topics in the full conversation.

Example 1: Want to find out where Garrett believes America sits in the ancient cycle of power and what might be coming next? Subscribe to Crazy Wisdom on Spotify and YouTube and hear the full episode.

Example 2: Catch the rest on Stewart Squared, as we break down the early signs of who's set to dominate the next decade of AI. And make sure to subscribe on Spotify and YouTube for more episodes like this.

Example 3: Want to find out who Garrett thinks is the modern master of gathering power? Subscribe to Crazy Wisdom on Spotify and YouTube to catch the rest of this conversation and listen to more episodes like this.

[CLIP CONTENT HERE]
```

**Implementation notes:**
- Run after `generateClips()` so clip content is available
- Pass each clip's text + full transcript to the prompt
- Use podcast name (Crazy Wisdom vs Stewart Squared) dynamically
- Output: One CTA per clip in a new "CALL TO ACTIONS" section of Master Doc

## 5. Future Automation Opportunities

Beyond the current backlog, these could be explored later:

| Opportunity | Effort | Value | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Music suggestions per clip | Medium | Medium | Suggest tracks based on clip tone/mood |
| Platform-specific post variants | Medium | Medium | Different copy for IG vs TikTok vs YouTube |
| Auto-generate Canva CTA images | High | Medium | Would require Canva API integration |

### Always Manual (Human Judgment Required)
| Step | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Clip selection from suggestions | Creative decision about what resonates |
| Boundary refinement in Riverside | Requires listening and judgment |
| Volume balancing | Subjective audio quality check |
| Final review before export | Quality assurance |
